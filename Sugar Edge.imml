    <strong>Digital experiences need a human component</strong>, because ideas worth exploring feel like you're holding a living heart in your hands.
    
    Working intimately at the intersection of Internet technology and real-life, we are inclusive, seeking perspective and asking bigger questions.
    
    Each of us has a voice, let your story unfold.

    <h2>A necessary discomfort.</h2>

    To create dynamics that serve all of society, we can't simply adapt the stories of the past into a digital space. The emerging world requires radical imagination and a keen smell for shifting realities.

    We question the status quo. Will you?

        We are passionate about improving lives with technology. To do that, we consider human needs and perspectives before involving any technology. We see every day how programmers, scientists and engineers create groundbreaking tools â€” but what happens when you put those inventions in the hands of artists, designers, architects and poets?
        
        That's our curiosity.
